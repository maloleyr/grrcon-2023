# Thursday Opening Keynote

## Guardians of Reality: Countering Hype in InfoSec

> Kevin Johnson

---

This was the opening keynote and thus no direct notes. However I will note that Kevin is a very authentic and sincere speaker. The core of his talk could be summarized as "Get back to the basics." 

He spoke of a group of sales people that he overheard at the airport. The client had a higher budget than the SKU being offered. Problem: We need to maximize profit. Ergo create a new SKU to meet the increased budget. Even though you are not delivering more _value._ This is the kind of crap that we, in InfoSec, need to name and shame and _not do._ 

He also spoke of all the hype coming down the line. AI this and that. Buy this tool and it'll fix it all! 

The thing that stuck the most is this: He's a capitalist. If you want to buy a Pen Test for $50k he'll sell it to you. However it isn't going to fix the base issue: THE FUNDAMENTALS! 

We need to get back to the basics as an industry. Good passwords. Better OpSec. Install the updates. Know your assets. Have an inventory. Know your employees. Train your employees. All of these advanced systems can help - however without the basics they are nothing more than another unmanaged layer.

I'd listen to him on this one.
