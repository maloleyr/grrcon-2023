## Raw Notes

- Injectyll-HIDe Project
- Man in the Middle HID Packets. Keylogger + wireless C2 (Command Control) via RF Radio.
- 999 potential implants on one mesh network.
- Log keystrokes. Keep PC from locking.
- Great for hotel cubes.
- Self-destruct mode: Delete local files (on device) and deactivate.
- Launch attack scripts via keyboard injection.
- Mounts as a COM port for communication channel. Essentially this create our own network thus no dependency on the local LAN.
- Reverse shell capability.
- Very slow to exfil data HOWEVER no LAN detection.

## Thoughts/Observations

I want these devices. I want all of these implants right now. This was one of my favorite sessions because it was practical and informative.
