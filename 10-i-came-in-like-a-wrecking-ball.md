## Raw Notes

- This presenter runs a small MSP focusing on small/medium businesses. 
- Large businesses are hardened. Small businesses are the low hanging fruit in this world. Plenty of opportunity for both the attackers AND defenders. Smaller businesses just don't have the resources of larger ones.
- KYC - Know Your Customer
- Think OpSec
- MullVad VPN == Cash transaction
- WiFi Pineapple - set 2min scan
- Hashcat for cracking wifi PW
- "Webhook"
- Adobe Free Logo Maker
- Just say no to Local Admin. Also Domain Admin.
- "The secret thoughts of successful women" - Book to read.
- WinPS2Exe -> Powershell -> Executable conversion
- Dehashed.com -> Breach data -> $150/yr
- HeidiSQL Client (Portable)

- Recommendations:
	- Gamify phishing
	- PW Managers
	- MFA
	- AV? -> EDR
	- SIEM
	- COLLABORATE!!!

## Thoughts/Observations

- This was an entertaining session. Essentially Vincent talked about how he breaches his client organization and pisses them off because he does so so easily. Very good information presented well.
