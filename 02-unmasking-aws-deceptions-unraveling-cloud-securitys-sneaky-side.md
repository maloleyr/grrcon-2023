- Attempt to manipulate the beliefs of others
- Exploit cognitive biases
- Influence to the benefit of the planner/defender

A fake digital resource that mimcs some characteristics of real resources. AKA a Honeypot or Canary (in the coalmine).

**Proactive security and defense tactic.**

A security resource whose value lies in being probed or attacked.

Goal: Enhance threat detection, gather intelligence, delay attack, and serve as a deterrent.
