# Intro

This is my repository of personal notes and observations from GrrCon 2023 in Grand Rapids, MI. They are organized by linear time. I did not get to every session and some sessions I did not take notes for. Below will be my overall observations and thoughts from the conference. 

# Observations and Thoughts

## Thursday

- I spent almost all day in sessions. In this repo will be the raw notes from those sessions.
- This was a tiring day. By 4pm I was in need of a nap - and I barely did anything! 
- Sessions overall were hit and miss. I think that a lot of speakers have trouble filling their full timeslot. 

After my sessions on Thursday I went to a nearby bar to decompress. I heard the after parties were difficult to get into.

## Friday

- Friday Keynote - My Ransomware Breach Story
	- I didn't take any notes for this one.
	- The stories though were educational and even comedic at times! 
	- Lots of lessons learned: 
		- Antivirus didn't always save a company BUT if you don't have antivirus (or really anything for protection) then you will be 0wned.
		- Obviously don't click phishing links.
		- You gotta remove local admin rights. Do it today. Do it now.
		- An MSP getting breached is a nightmare situation. The attacker will use your own client management tools to deploy their ransomware. 
		- You need to mix up the credentials used for different clients. Don't reuse credentials! 
		- Get insurance. Keep insurance. Use insurance.
- I then spent some time in the vendor hall getting lunch, beer, and doing the car hacking village.
- Car hacking was a TON of fun! GRIMM does a great job putting it together. 
- I then attended three afternoon sessions before heading out early due to an engagement.
- Afternoon sessions: 
	- Undisclosed with Atlas of D00m:
		- I totally didn't put together his alias and who he is originally. I actually used to work with Matt at Amway.
		- His talk essentially boiled down to the story of how he got where he is today, lessons learned, and recommendations that anyone could use. 
		- His overall experience was much wider and entertaining than I expected.
		- Some recommendations: How To Make Friends and Influence People; Let people talk; "FROM" Family, Recreation, Occupation, Motivation -- use to help hold conversations.
		- He still likes to use Linux and so do I!
	- MSP's Suck but the world without them is worse
		- Two MSP owners give their experiences.
		- Outcome: Yes, we need MSPs even the shittier ones. They do help. However we can _all do better_ by working together.
	- Boats are Scary: Aaron "Finux" Finnon
		- This was a classic finux talk. It may not be entirely security related but it was still entertaining.
		- Apparently he bought a boat. And the water can be scary. Also the equipment on boats is inherently insecure. Yet you need to secure _the things_ and not the systems.

# Conclusion

GrrCon is one of my favorite events of the year. I can't believe it took me so long to start attending regularly. It was great to see old and new friends alike. There were three people from my organization there and I do wish we did better coordination. We also had several customers in attendance that would have been nice to coordinate with. 

It really felt like the theme this year was "back to the basics." I feel inspired to actually present on that as a topic. I might try to create a generic presentation on that topic that can be used at conventions and other speaking events.
