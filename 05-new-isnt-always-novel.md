- How to breakdown complex problems. Reverse engineering is an example.
- Set milestones. Find 0day with Remote Code Execution. This was the final goal. 
- Observe. Orient. Decide. Act. OODA Loop - John Boyd.
- Pwn20wn: Cash prizes and points.
- Get firmware decryption key from an old printer.
- Removed flash chip from old USB stick.
