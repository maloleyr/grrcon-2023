## Raw Notes

- **Don't pretend to be a COP.**
- Understand the intentions of others.
- Get useful things from others and prevent it from happening to you.
- Methods: 
	- Soft/Hard (how they feel)
	- Individual/Team
	- Engineering/Dissecting
- Soft: Initially disarming, non-hostile, "normal" dialogue.
- Hard: Confrontational/Focus is specific and time sensitive. Building pressure.
- Combo: Emotional rollercoaster -> Physically exhausting.
- Don't get flustered by unexpected things. Practice with small children. (OK that seems a little weird but true).
- Meet expectations: Caring/Honest/Competent
- Let Them Talk.
- People like to talk about themselves.
- Meet *or subvert* expectations based on wanted outcomes.
- Typical detective: Stache, coffee mug, serious, matter of fact. 
- How to identify when you are the mark? 
	- Dream job offer
	- "Too good to be true"
	- Urgency
	- Feel uncomfortable
- What to Do
	- Verify credentials. Don't rely on what they tell you. Terminate or stall interaction.
