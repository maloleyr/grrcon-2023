## Friction

> J Wolfgang Goerlich

## Raw Notes

- How can we design a better experience?
- Paths they take -> Choices they make
- Who? All - Developers, System Administrators, End Users, and others...
- "Fucking Unity"
- Reduce friction for users should be a goal.
- Increase friction of attackers is also a goal. How to balance?
- Push Bombing AKA MFA Fatigue: Low friction for the attacker, high friction for the user.
- "Friction of adversaries not for users."
- "It's great they didn't mention us it shows low frictions." BAD
- Too little friction is as bad as too much friction.
- "Security is a feeling and its a reality." Bruce Schnier. 
- People associate friction with security. 
- **Elevate Security**
- When work looks like work it gets done. Friction is what is new.
- "Risk is a function of hazard and outrage." Peter Sandman
- If people can understand it... if people can control it... it feels like less friction.
- Predictability: If friction occurs consistently as a result of the persons action they are OK.
- The feeling of friction is proportional to the value of the experience.
- The Droste Effect
- Avoid "Bumper Sticker" language
- Friction isn't the problem. Mindlessly reducing it is.
- Use Human Centered Design to use friction to drive behavior.

## Thoughts/Observations

This was a very thought-provoking session full of great information and soundbites. Especially the last part as my organization does a lot of human centered design activities. This is something we push for our clients. I really like the idea of keeping friction in balance. Remove it and you make it easier for attackers. Enhance it then you piss off the end users and will reduce your security. It truly is a balance.
